# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the project.

## `sluggify.mjs`

This script is used to ensure that all blog post filenames are URL-friendly "slugs".

### What it does

- It scans the `src/data/blog` directory.
- It finds any filenames that contain spaces or uppercase letters.
- It renames them to be lowercase and to use hyphens instead of spaces. For example, `My New Post.mdx` would be renamed to `my-new-post.mdx`.

### Why it's needed

Astro generates page URLs from the filenames of your content. Filenames with spaces or special characters can lead to broken links or errors. This script enforces a consistent, URL-safe naming convention.

### How to use it

You can run the script from the root of the project using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm sluggify
```

It's recommended to run this after adding new blog post files.

---

## `buildThemes.mjs`

This script extracts theme names from `src/styles/themes.css`. It then generates two files:

- `src/Types/theme-names.ts`: A TypeScript type definition for the theme names.
- `src/utils/themeNames.js`: A JavaScript array of the theme names.

This script is run as part of the build process and should not be run manually.

---

## `getPosts.ts`

This TypeScript module exports a function `getPosts` that retrieves all blog posts from the Astro collections defined in `src/alkaline.config.ts`. It filters out draft posts in production builds.

---

## `robots-txt.config.ts`

This file configures the `astro-robots-txt` integration. It defines the `robots.txt` file content, which controls how search engines crawl the site. It can disallow indexing based on the `SITE.disableIndexing` setting in `src/alkaline.config.ts`.

---

## `themeNames.js`

This file is auto-generated by `buildThemes.mjs` and exports an array of theme names. It should not be edited manually.
