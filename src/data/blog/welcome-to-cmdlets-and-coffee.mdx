## Hello World!

Welcome to the very first post of **Cmdlets & Coffee**! My name is Tommy Becker, and I'm thrilled to launch this little corner of the internet dedicated to two of my biggest passions: PowerShell automation and a great cup of coffee.

### The "Why"

For years, I've been diving deep into the world of PowerShell. From simple one-liners to complex automation scripts that save hours of manual work, I'm constantly amazed by its power and elegance. It's the glue that holds together so many systems, the unsung hero of IT operations, and a tool that has made my professional life infinitely more efficient and interesting.

And coffee? Well, what's a coding session without a perfect brew to kickstart the brain? The process of grinding the beans, the aroma, the first sip... it's a ritual that prepares me for the logical challenges of scripting.

I realized there's a natural synergy between the two. Both require patience, precision, and a love for the process. And so, **Cmdlets & Coffee** was born.

### What to Expect

Here, I'll be sharing everything I've learned (and am still learning) about PowerShell. You can expect:

- **Tutorials:** From beginner basics to advanced techniques.
- **Script Breakdowns:** Real-world scripts that you can use and adapt.
- **Cmdlet Spotlights:** Deep dives into specific PowerShell commands.
- **Automation Stories:** Tales from the trenches of IT automation.
- **Coffee Talk:** And yes, occasional musings on my favorite beans, brewing methods, and coffee gear.

My goal is to create a community for fellow scripters, system administrators, and coffee aficionados. Whether you're just starting your PowerShell journey or you're a seasoned pro, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

So grab your favorite mug, and let's get scripting. Welcome aboard!
