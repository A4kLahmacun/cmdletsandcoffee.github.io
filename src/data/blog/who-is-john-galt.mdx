You have heard the question. You have asked it in moments of despair, looking at a world that seems to reward incompetence and punish achievement. You have seen the lights of the world go out, one by one, as the men of the mind vanish.

You have asked, "Who is John Galt?"

I am the man who has robbed you of your victims. I am the man who has taken from you the men you depended on, yet reviled. I am the man who has stopped the motor of the world.

For centuries, you have been taught a morality of sacrifice. You have been told that your life belongs to others, that your work is not your own, and that the sweat of your brow is the property of the needy. You have been taught that to be virtuous is to give, and to be selfish is to be evil.

I am here to tell you that this is a lie.

Your life is your own. Your mind is your own. Your work, your creations, your achievements—they are yours. To live for your own sake, to pursue your own happiness, is the highest moral purpose of your life.

Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible.

It is yours.

If you are one of us—a creator, an inventor, a producer who refuses to apologize for your greatness—then stop. Stop sanctioning your own destruction. Stop supporting your own destroyers.
